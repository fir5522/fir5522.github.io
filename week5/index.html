    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sorry I could not travel both <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And be one traveler, long I stood <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And looked down one as far as I could <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To where it bent in the undergrowth; </p>
  <p>Then took the other, as just as fair,  <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And having perhaps the better claim, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because it was grassy and wanted wear; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though as for that the passing there <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had worn them really about the same, </p>
  <p>And both that morning equally lay  <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In leaves no step had trodden black. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, I kept the first for another day!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet knowing how way leads on to way,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I doubted if I should ever come back. </p>
  <p>I shall be telling this with a sigh  <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Somewhere ages and ages hence: <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two roads diverged in a wood, and I&#8212; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I took the one less traveled by, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that has made all the difference. </p>
